# Collaborative Website Project Using Git and GitHub
## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to help students understand the basic concepts of Git, including repository creation, branching, committing, and pushing changes to a remote repository on GitHub. The students will also learn how to collaborate with others by cloning a repository, creating branches, and merging changes.

This assignment will help students gain hands-on experience with Git and GitHub, as well as understand the importance of version control in collaborative projects.

### Estimated Time: 2 hours
## Assignment Overview
Students will work in teams of 3 to collaboratively build a simple static website (e.g., a portfolio site) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each student will be responsible for creating a specific section of the website. The goal is to practice using Git for version control and GitHub for collaboration.

# Steps
Set Up Git and GitHub:

1. Each student should install Git on their local machine.
2. Create a GitHub account if they don't already have one.
3. One student in each team will create a new repository on GitHub named team-portfolio.

### Clone the Repository

1. Each student will clone the team-portfolio repository to their local machine.
2. Create a Branch for Each Team Member:
Each student should create a new branch from the main branch named after their section of the website (e.g., header-section, about-section, footer-section).
Build the Website:

3. Each student will independently work on their section of the website.
Add their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in their respective branch.
Commit Changes:

4. Students should commit their changes with meaningful commit messages (e.g., "Added header section with navigation").
Push Changes to GitHub:

5. After committing, each student should push their branch to the remote repository on GitHub.
Create a Pull Request:

6. Once all students have pushed their changes, they should open a pull request on GitHub to merge their branch into the main branch.

### Team members should review each other's code before merging.

1. Resolve Merge Conflicts:
If there are any merge conflicts, students should work together to resolve them before finalizing the merge.

2. Merge the Branches:
After resolving conflicts, each pull request should be merged into the main branch.
Final Review:
The team should review the main branch to ensure that all sections are correctly integrated and the website functions as expected.
Submission:
One student from each team should submit the GitHub repository link to the instructor.

### Deliverables
1. A GitHub repository link containing the team-portfolio project.
2. At least three branches with individual commits from each team member.
3. Evidence of collaboration through pull requests and code reviews on GitHub.

### Grading Criteria:
##### Repository Structure (20%): Proper branch names, directory structure, and organization.
##### Commit Quality (20%): Meaningful commit messages and logical commit history.
##### Pull Requests and Collaboration (30%): Evidence of collaboration, pull requests, and conflict resolution.
##### Code Quality (20%): Well-written, functional code for the website sections.
##### Final Integrated Website (10%): The final integrated product as seen on the main branch.
##### Additional Notes:
##### Encourage students to document any issues they encounter and how they resolved them in a README.md file.
